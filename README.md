# Object Detection and Image Processing

## Description
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and scripts for **object detection** and **image processing**, specifically designed for RGB, TIR (Thermal Infrared), and RGB-TIR fused datasets. The notebooks include tools for:
- Installing dependencies and setting up the environment.
- Mounting Google Drive for data access.
- Applying various image processing filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection, etc.).
- Visualizing processed images and comparing results.
- Training custom object detection models using YOLOv7.

The repository is designed for researchers and developers working on multi-modal (RGB + TIR) object detection tasks.
